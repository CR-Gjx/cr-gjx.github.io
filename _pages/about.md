- I am now a Research Scientist at Google Research Australia, dedicated to enhancing the inference efficiency of large foundation models and proposing efficient model architectures.

- At Google, I am the main contributor of [Gemma3n](https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/gemma-3n/), the open-sourced LLM for on-device scenarios, where I launched one of the main architectural changes. I also contributed [Gemini-2.5](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/) series and model design of the next generation Gemini. 

- Concurrently, I serve as a visiting researcher at [Matsuo Lab](https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) at the University of Tokyo, where I mentor students exploring **LLM-based agents, causality in LLMs and multi-modal large language models**. I am looking for outstanding and highly motivated students or collaborators to work together in the above directions. **Please feel free to contact me if you are interested**.
  
- I was a PostDoc at the University of Tokyo, advised by Dr. [Shane Gu](https://sites.google.com/view/gugurus) and Prof. [Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/index.html).

- I was a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at The University of Sydney, advised by Prof. [Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html) and Dr. [Mingming Gong](https://mingming-gong.github.io/).

- I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and was the leader of Text Generation Group in [Apex](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/) Lab from 2017 to 2018. My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu), Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/).

- My current research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in causal learning, reinforcement learning and domain adaptation methods, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, computer vision and natural language processing.
